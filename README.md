# The Mood Room Database

This project is a SQL database feature designed for the Mood Room — a mental wellness platform I'm building. It focuses on the mood kit ordering system, allowing users to browse, order, and track healing kits based on their emotional needs.

## Features Included

- Users table with basic profile data
- Mood kits table (digital and physical kits)
- Orders table with timestamp tracking
- Foreign key relationships between users and orders
- 6 test queries to validate the database structure

## Technologies

- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench (EER Diagram)

## Sample Queries

Query files are included to:
- View all users
- Get mood kits by tag
- Find orders within a date range
- And more...

## Personal Note

This database isn't just a workshop — it's an actual part of the future Mood Room app launching in 2026. ✨
